	I thought you meant the murders.;
					@$H
	What? No. There were only just the two of those.;
					SYSTEM
	Husto was now playing with his coffee soaked tie.;
					@$V
	Would you cut that shit out?;
	We have a job to do;
					SYSTEM
	We slowly made our way to the tower entrance.;
	We were going to be the second team at the crime scene.;
	This was how things worked now.; Two teams working against each other.;
	The |Police|, and |A.R.M.I|.;
	I was with |A.R.M.I|, along with my partner, $H;
	Inside this tower, a husband and wife were found murdered.;
	They had been disintegrated by the |white light|.;
	The police have been calling these white light attacks murder.;
	I wasn't so sure at first.;
	That is until I saw the damage myself.;
	If this wasn't murder, then freak accidents were getting more sadistic.;
	This was the second murder this week. Unless you were to count this as |two| murders...;
	I wouldn't though. The victims both died at the same exact time.;
					@$V
	Any new details on this case I should know about?
					@$H
	A potential witness was found at the scene.;
					SYSTEM
	The last time we found a witness at a white light murder, they hadn't been much help.;
	That's because they had lost their minds.; They only spoke in nonsense now.;
					@$V
	Shit. Who is this witness?;
					@$H
	Fuck if I know. The daughter I think. Some little kid- IX years old.;
					SYSTEM
	As we arrived, we were greeted by the |Chief of Police|, |Victor Walsh|.;
					@$H
	Ah, ©Chief Walsh©. Good to see you. Forgive my tie. Damn drinks again.;
					@$C
	Forget all that. Listen you two...;
	About the witness. It's their daughter...;

	She's... Not well.

	The victim is fragile. I'm sure you won't cause her any unwarranted stress.;
					@$H
	Hey, leave this part to us will you?;
	We don't need the Police screwing up this case like the last one.;
					@$C
	Why you arog-;
					@$V
	Alright you two, don't do this here.;
					@$C
	You are right. I'm sorry. It's true that the Police aren't really trained for this sort of task.;
	Just be gentle, will you?;
	Oh, and before I leave.;
	These are for you.;
					SYSTEM
	©$C handed over the crime scene photos.©
					@$C
	This is what the scene looked like before the |cleanup crew| arrived.;
	SYSTEM
	The |cleanup crew| was the first responding sub-team of the Police.;
	They arrive even before the police to take a 4D photo set of the scene, and clean the place spotless.;
	Once they are done, almost can't tell that a crime was committed.;
	I used to work cleanup. I don't miss it.;
					@$V
	Thanks, we'll look over these.;
					@$C
	Make sure you do.; 
	They should hold the key to this whole ordeal.;
	That is, unless you still believe in eyewitnesses.

         * The Affinity class should be used by the TurnLoopSystem.cs class
         * call SetupMap to set up affinity, and add functions here to test damage.
         * damage should probably be done via the DoAttack class or in the Actor Damage() function. not sure which yet...
         * 
         * CharacterAffinity should be an object of Actor.cs class
         * 
         * Alternativly, make the affinity a member of Actor instead, and just have duplicate copys of the Dictionary that defines weaknesses and cut 
         * out the TurnLoopSystem alltogether...
         * 
         * 
         * Affinity results go to the attacker
         * Normal: The affinity's do not effect one another.
         * Weak: The attacking affinity is weak to the opposing affinity so damage is halved.
         * Strong The attacking affinity is stronger the the opposing affinity, so damage is doubled
